			Thankyou for showing interest, 
			here is a quick story of me and
			this website. My programming 
			journey started back in 2023, 
			few months before I started 
			studying CSE in Galgotias University. 
			I am currently in my second 
			year. I like coding all kind of problems 
			from the very basic like adding 
			numbers to the complex ones like
			competitive programming problems.
			I love making projects and games.
			Infact this website is one of my 
			Web Development Projects which 
			is built using HTML and CSS.<br>
			<br>Languages known : C Language, 
            Python. OOP, HTML, CSS & GitHub.
